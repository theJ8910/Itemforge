theJ89: Well duh, I made the system
Azui-Sleet:  His world model correction code eventually lead me to a final solution to the itemforge_item_held_* world model issues. This code forms the foundation of bone-merged gear attachments.

Doctor Communism: Suggested ammo belts (in concept, not in name) that allow guns to use linked containers for ammo sources.
Ebayle: Let me use his server and suggested a numbering system for the SWEP names.
Night-Eagle: Solved my problem with drawing a texture in a circle in the inventory.
MegaDeath409: Suggested caching classes as necessary to improve speeds. Kicked my ass to finally make item-types reloadable. Suggested wire-neutral system.
thomasfn: Gave me a snippet of code used to register several copies of itemforge_item_held so I didn't have to have so many physical copies
Josh: Suggested the use of networking macros (that pass minimal information)
Karolis O.: Created the Item Magnet icon.
Mr. Bix: Many, many suggestions for ways to improve the items and system in general. Dedicated playtester.
NeoDement: Created the viewmodel for the sawblade (for a "Sawblade Thrower" SWEP)

grea$emonkey: Reminded me to decomment lua files before checking for include statements.
